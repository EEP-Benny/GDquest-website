We&rsquo;ve all had a tough time getting started <em>whether we remember it or not</em>.</p><p>To make games alone you have to learn both:</p><ol><li><strong>Game design</strong>, how to come up with interesting mechanics, rules, and goals for the players</li><li>And <strong>programming</strong>, or how to translate your design in a language that the computer understands</li></ol><p>That&rsquo;s a lot to tackle all at once! Like any creative discipline, it takes time. Don&rsquo;t worry though: learning can be a fun experience!</p><figure><img src="./img/one-step-at-a-time.jpg" alt="A cat walking down stairs"><figcaption><p>Code and design are whole new worlds to discover and explore. Take your time, stay curious.</p></figcaption></figure><p>You may not be able to communicate your vision at first and you&rsquo;ll stumble upon obstacles along the way. But you&rsquo;ll also have plenty of &laquo;ah-ha&raquo; moments and deep satisfaction when your family and friends get to play your games.</p><p>When you are just starting out, you should <strong>focus on code and game design separately</strong>. Be it in parallel or one after the other, you should learn the basics, write a few programs, design simple games on paper&hellip; then bring both disciplines together to make video games.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to explore in this series, starting with programming.</p><h2 id="what-do-you-want-to-create">What do <strong>you</strong> want to create?</h2><p>To stay motivated it&rsquo;s best if you understand why you&rsquo;re learning and what your objectives are.</p><p>What drives you to create your own game? Take a moment to think about the following questions:</p><ul><li>What game do you want to make?</li><li>Are you doing this for fun, as a hobby, or to become a professional?</li><li>What do you need to learn first to achieve these two goals?</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong answer here. Here&rsquo;s how I got started, a long time ago:</p><blockquote><p>I want to create a small RPG inspired by Japanese games for fun, finish it, and share it with my friends. I want to do everything so I need to learn to do game design, to write a story, to code the game, to draw characters and environments, to design levels, to make sounds and music, &hellip; err, where should I start?</p><footer>Naive 13 years old me</footer></blockquote><p>It was a lot to take on alone but this goal became the beacon that guided me all these years: I&rsquo;ve built foundations in all of these domains to some degree. Jack of all trades, certainly master of none! It took me a long time to be able to make games as I got into programming last.</p><figure><img src="./img/shapes-old-game-project.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an old abandonned RPG project"><figcaption><p>One of our old Adventure game projects with Nemega</p></figcaption></figure><p>You will have to be patient. Start small and hone each skill you need separately. You don&rsquo;t have to do everything all alone either. With a little bit of experience you can team up with complementary game creators during game jams for example.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s assume that you want to make video games by yourself. Maybe it would just be game prototypes that you can try out with your friends and flesh out with the help of a developer at a later stage. You&rsquo;re going to have to dive into code, but&hellip;</p><h2 id="to-code-games-you-need-programming-foundations">To code games, you need programming foundations</h2><p>If you jump straight in a game editor and try to write code you&rsquo;re in trouble. A game engines is a large collection of technologies that add hundreds, if not thousands of new tools and functions to learn on top of programming foundations. You&rsquo;re going to get stuck often and you&rsquo;ll hit frustrating roadblocks. If you don&rsquo;t know what variables, functions, loops, objects, and classes are or how they work to some extent, you&rsquo;ll want to <strong>build solid foundations</strong> first.</p><blockquote><p>You need to write code to become a developer. Many beginners are afraid to write code that breaks. You won&rsquo;t break your computer. Sure your app will crash and there may be bugs but that&rsquo;s okay. You can only learn by trying.</p><footer><a href="https://twitter.com/valryon/">Valryon</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://pixelnest.io/">Pixelnest</a></footer></blockquote><p><img src="img/sterenden.png" alt=""></p><p>To get good foundations you should:</p><ol><li>Learn your <strong>first language</strong> and get a sense for basic programming tools like variables, functions, loops, and classes</li><li><strong>Write</strong> simple programs like text-only interactive games or scripts to automate boring tasks on your computer</li><li><strong>Read</strong> code from other people and try to understand what it does</li></ol><p><span class="note">Programming - especially game programming - is a creative activity. You can spend your entire life exploring new techniques and sharpening your skills. Take your time and try to enjoy the journey.</span></p><p>Keep the <strong>KISS</strong> principle in mind to avoid frustration: <strong>Keep it Short and Sweet</strong>. You can learn fast with short focused practice sessions.</p><h2 id="the-first-language-you-ll-learn-isn-t-that-important">The first language you&rsquo;ll learn isn&rsquo;t that important</h2><p>There are <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_programming_languages">hundreds of programming languages </a>out there. But it isn&rsquo;t that* bad: by learning one language you learn a lot more than syntax. You&rsquo;re going to learn concepts like variables, loops, and objects that work about the same in most programming languages. C++, Java, C#, etc. have a lot of similarities so moving from one to the next won&rsquo;t feel like starting over again.</p><figure><img src="./img/programming-languages-books.jpg" alt="A large pile of programming books with many different languages"><figcaption><p>Dozens of languages are represented in these old tech and programming textbooks. CC 3.0 SA Victorgrigas</p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Learning a given language is a small part of learning programming</strong>. As you gain experience, you&rsquo;ll acquire more and more knowledge that you will be able to transpose across tools and languages: how to structure your code, how to avoid bugs, how to learn on your own with a programming manual or reference&hellip;</p><h2 id="programming-is-for-everyone">Programming is for everyone</h2><p>You don&rsquo;t need to start with a tough, low-level language like C++. When I was in middle school, a more experienced developer taught me C++, his argument being that it is one of the most widely used languages. At the age of 14, I got a 1000 pages long intro to C++. I had a horrible experience reading it and concluded that programming was not for me. I was disgusted from programming and stayed away from code for years.</p><p>I got back into code with Construct 2&rsquo;s visual event system, working as a junior game designer on mobile games. The engine&rsquo;s creators sold it as a <em>programming-free</em> engine. That seemed perfect for a designer like me!</p><figure><img src="./img/construct-2-event-sheets.png" alt="Construct 2&#39;s event blocks"><figcaption><p>Construct&#39;s event sheets work by picking conditions on the left and coding actions or consequences on the right</p></figcaption></figure><p>It took me a few months to realize that I was storing values in variables, writing calculations, using functions and loops, data containers like arrays… I was coding all this time. And it was fun! From there I learned some JavaScript followed by Python. It sure had nothing to do with C++. The tutorials were a lot more accessible and both languages much simpler to use.</p><p>There are different types of developers, and different paths to becoming a developer. There are languages, programs, and technologies that will prove to be a better fit for your skills and what you want to make.</p><blockquote><p>Programming is for everyone. You don&rsquo;t need to be a man, to be young or &laquo;gifted&raquo;. If I had started earlier I would&rsquo;ve avoided a lot of obstacles in my career. It&rsquo;s a myth that we should debunk right now.</p><footer><a href="http://fenntasy.com/wanuts/">Florïn Zolli</a>, level designer at Ankama (Dofus, Wakfu), community manager at MotionTwin, now studying development</footer></blockquote><p>Women can code just as well as men. Designers and artists can also code. Again: <strong>programming is for everyone</strong>. You&rsquo;ve just got to find the tool that&rsquo;s right for you.</p><h2 id="don-t-start-with-c">Don&rsquo;t start with C++</h2><p>Unless you like to learn the hard way, you don&rsquo;t have to start with C++. C++ is a <strong>complicated</strong>, feature-packed language designed to write code that runs fast. It&rsquo;s not meant to be accessible. It&rsquo;s not meant to be part of your first programming experience. Especially if you are young and don&rsquo;t like math or if you are not very comfortable with a computer. Lucky for us, it&rsquo;s not necessary at all to get started with programming or to become a professional game developer.</p><figure><img src="./img/c&#43;&#43;-book.jpg" alt="Three programming books piled up, dedicated to the C and C&#43;&#43; programming languages"><figcaption><p>It&#39;s one of these monolithic programming books that made me hate programming at first</p></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>There are different types of developers: some like to code for the sake of it while others are driven by projects. You shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraged if you aren&rsquo;t part of the first group. I don&rsquo;t like math, or programming in itself, it&rsquo;s ok : it doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from creating games.</p><p></p><footer><a href="http://fenntasy.com/wanuts/">Florïn Zolli</a><p></p></footer></blockquote><p>There are <strong>thousands of ways to code</strong>. You don&rsquo;t have to do complex math to build games. You can challenge yourself with complex algorithms if you want to. Or just animate characters moving on the screen!</p><p>Even if it feels scientific at first, programming is a creative problem-solving activity. There are always multiple solutions for a given problem. In an upcoming guide in this series you&rsquo;ll learn about a paradigm, a set of mental tools to structure your code called <strong>Object-Oriented Design</strong>. As the name suggests it involves design work. Keep this in mind as you&rsquo;re taking your first steps: doing code is not just about maths. I am a designer at heart and I enjoy programming.</p><figure><img src="./img/object-oriented-design.png" alt="Diagram of two monsters inheriting from a base class"><figcaption><p>Object-Oriented Design is a tool to make your game code manageable</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="visual-programming-is-still-computer-code">Visual programming is still computer code</h2><p>Do you feel uncomfortable writing code as text? At first that&rsquo;s normal; you&rsquo;re learning to communicate with a machine using a foreign tongue.</p><p>You may be tempted to stick to visual programming tools, thinking it&rsquo;s not really programming but it is. Whether you use Scratch, Clickteam Fusion, Unreal&rsquo;s Blueprints or anything similar, you already have some programming experience.</p><figure><img src="./img/godot-visual-scripting-language.png" alt="Screenshot of Godot&#39;s VisualScript editor, a visual programming language"><figcaption><p>Game engines like Unreal or Godot offer an extensible visual scripting languages for designers and artists.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As a beginner the main differences between text-based and visual programming are:</p><ol><li>Visual programming is a little more accessible at first, as it is visual in nature, but is often slower to write and manage as your code gets more complex</li><li>With text-based code you can make typos. Unlike us, a computer can&rsquo;t make sense of a keyword if you swap two letters.<ul><li>But modern code editors are here to help: they smartly autocomplete keywords as you type, they can tell you when you&rsquo;ve made a mistake and often even highlight issues for you.</li><li>As with every discipline, practice makes perfect: the more you write, the fewer typos you&rsquo;ll make.</li></ul></li></ol><p><span class="note">A code editor can report errors when you run the program and it fails. You will then see the error report as text in a programming console. Text editors can also read your code as you are typing it and report the most common errors before you run your project. This is called <strong>linting</strong>.</span></p><figure><img src="./img/godot-gdscript-fuzzy-autocomplete.png" alt="Screenshot of Godot&#39;s GDscript editor with fuzzy code autocompletion"><figcaption><p>Godot&#39;s script editor suggests the right keywords even if you don&#39;t type all letters or invert some</p></figcaption></figure><p>In my experience working only with visual languages does not scale well. As your projects grow in size, visual languages will become more inconvenient. They&rsquo;re often slower to use than text as you end up navigating through menus and connecting blocks to do basic operations.</p><p>To give you an idea the VisualScript example above only takes 2 lines in the text-based GDscript language:</p><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> _process(delta):
	position <span style="color:#f92672">+=</span> direction <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> speed <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> delta</code></pre></div><p>You will only see the drawbacks of visual code after you have learned and gotten comfortable with text-based programming. It is okay to start with visual code. Just don&rsquo;t count other programming languages out because they&rsquo;re harder for you to get started with. As a designer I&rsquo;m glad I made the transition: it felt a little uncomfortable at first but I never looked back.</p><h2 id="i-recommend-to-start-with-python">I recommend to start with Python</h2><p>As a game development tutor, I see so many <strong>beginners jump head first in an engine and fail</strong>. They follow step-by-step tutorials or copy-paste code from demo projects hoping to build their own dream project. As they lack programming foundations they get stuck as soon as they tweak a line of code. Doing that, you mostly end up wasting time and building up frustration.</p><p>Coding is like writing in a foreign language: you&rsquo;ve got to learn some basic vocabulary and grammar first, use everything you learn as often as possible in order to commit it to memory, and take your time.</p><p><strong>Be patient</strong>. It won&rsquo;t take too much time before you can get started with game programming. Try to spend about 20 hours focusing on programming basics. Then you can start having fun with game development if you want. Just don&rsquo;t forget to keep building and sharpening your core programming skills in parallel!</p><p><img src="./img/python-logo.png" alt="Python programming language logo"></p><p>I recommend to start with Python for at least 3 reasons:</p><ol><li>You can create <strong>all kinds of programs</strong> with it: automate tasks on your computer, code web applications, science applications, even games&hellip;</li><li>It has a <strong>huge active community</strong>. Python is taught in many schools and universities so it&rsquo;s easy to find good learning resources for teenagers and adults alike. My friend Chris Bradiel even <a href="http://kidscancode.org/">teaches Python to kids </a>!</li><li>It is easy to approach thanks to its <strong>simple syntax</strong></li></ol><p>Python looks like this:</p><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript">numbers <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span>]

</code></pre><p><strong>Python is great to get started with code</strong>. For aspiring game creators it&rsquo;s also a reliable tool: it&rsquo;s the most common language to write plug-ins for graphic applications such as Blender, Krita, and Gimp. This is not only true for Free Software: large 3D applications like Maya or 3DSMax also let you write new features with Python.</p><blockquote><p>During the last Europython I&rsquo;ve met companies who use Python in game development work. Crytek and EA (Frostbyte) use it in their assets pipeline, the build system, and automated tests.</p><footer>Emmanuel aka TouilleMan, author of the <a href="https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python">Python support in Godot</a></footer></blockquote><p>As explained earlier, we&rsquo;re talking about your first text-based language here. It certainly won&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t be the last you&rsquo;ll study. Python is a good stepping stone on your learning journey: it&rsquo;s a middleground between visual programming languages like Scratch and strict ones like C++.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll find few games written in the Python language. Game development companies mostly use Python for the creation of tools outside of the game engine: everything that has to do with processing art and other assets to use in the game for example.</p><figure><img src="./img/jetbrains-python-uses-2017-survey.png" alt="Graph showing the percentage of Python developers who use the language for data science, web development, etc."><figcaption><p>One in four Python developer uses it for educational purposes</p></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Various studies show that the number of Python developers is growing steadily year by year.

I heard Python is slow.</summary><p></p><p>When you&rsquo;re learning how to code, the language or the engine&rsquo;s performances is the least of your concerns. Today&rsquo;s computers are so fast you will have to try very hard to bring them to their knees. Your goal at this point should be to learn to code, not to write fast applications. Lastly, most of the performance issues you&rsquo;ll face will come from your own code.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the language&rsquo;s performances. You may have heard Python is a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic language </a>and that it is slower than classic languages like C or C++. It turns out that Python is built upon the C language so most of the instructions you write in a dynamic language like Python call code written in the comparatively fast C language.</p><p>The same is true when you work with a game engine. Many rely on a dynamic language to help code gameplay mechanics fast. These languages, often called scripting languages, may be slower than C++ but every engine feature you use, like drawing on the screen, uses the fast engine&rsquo;s C++ core.</p><p>Back to Python. You can compile Python code just like C or C++ and get the same speed and control over your code. If you really need to.</p><figure><img src="./img/pypy-logo.png" alt="PyPy Python JIT compiler logo"><figcaption><p>Pypy does Just-In-Time compilation to make your Python code run faster</p></figcaption></figure><p>But again: you shouldn&rsquo;t think about performances when you&rsquo;re learning. When starting a game, professional game developers don&rsquo;t care so much about performance as you can always improve performance later. Most of the time it&rsquo;s only a tiny part of the game&rsquo;s code that drags the performances down.</p><p>However using a language that&rsquo;s easy to read and fast to write saves you a lot of development time. That&rsquo;s why, as you&rsquo;ll see, game engines like Godot generally provide two languages: one back-end language for the fast core, and one or more scripting languages for the gameplay.</p></details><p></p><section class="card darkbg no-margin flex horizontal profile"><div class="avatar" style="background-image: url(http://gdquest.com/img/avatar/nathan.png)"></div><div class="small-padding content"><h3 class="no-margin" data-font="ultrabold capitalize">Nathan Lovato</h3><div class="social-links tiny-spaced-children"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nathan.lovato.9" title="Facebook page" class="icon" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest" title="Twitter page" class="icon" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> </a><a href="http://youtube.com/c/gdquest" title="Youtube page" class="icon" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a></div><p>I&#39;m a courteous game designer, with a taste for open source.
