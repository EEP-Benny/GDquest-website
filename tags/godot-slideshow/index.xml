      <description>The last chapter of the Godot course is here! The project is now out of early access. ðŸ˜„
Make Professional 2D Games with Godot is the first intermediate-level course for the Godot Game Engine.
Unlike many on-demand online courses, it is modular: you can watch the chapters in any order as they all focus on a specific topic.
In every series, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn specific techniques like steering motion or how to code Finite State Machines, that will help you solve the many problems you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter in your projects.</description>
