      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s update you get one new chapter in the course. This is the hardest and probably the biggest series I made so far: chapter 5 is dedicated to boss creation.
This builds upon chapters 1 to 3 and brings the state programming pattern  to everyone, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve got the essentials, the indie, or the pro version.
As the boss chapter took twice the time I planned to invest in it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the essentials version in May.</description>

      <description>The new update is out! As announced in the last news post, it&amp;rsquo;s smaller than usual. for two reasons:
 I moved to Japan, took some time off and had a lot to do to settle down I caught a cold and worked slower than usual for the past 10 days. Over the past week I barely had any voice at all  Work has still been busy until the end of the month: it not only took a while to get back to everyone, catch up with activity on GitHub, but also to get back up to speed in a foreign country.</description>

      <description>Last week-end we went to the Capitole du Libre, a major event around Free Software in France, to showcase Godot. We met there with Gilles RoudiÃ¨re and Julian Murgia, two active contributors.
It was a busy event: even though there were fewer visitors than at FOSDEM, people kept coming to the Godot table, curious about the engine&amp;rsquo;s features.
Julian and Gilles gave a two-hours workshop based on @KidsCanCode&amp;rsquo;s Your first game  tutorial.</description>

      <description>Last week we did a tutorial about attack mechanics in collaboration with Heartbeast. I got important feedback from you, the backers, and wanted to apply it to a self-contained tutorial. Consider it as a bonus while we&amp;rsquo;re waiting for Godot 3 beta.
Close combat attack:
 Weapon Animation  Weapon collision programming   Heartbeast&amp;rsquo;s tutorial:
 Ranged attack: fireball   It shows some of Godot&amp;rsquo;s strengths:
 Inherited scenes act as a base class that child scenes derive from, but you control it all through the editor.</description>

      <title>Waiting for Godot 3: Why There Was No Course Update in September</title>
      <link>http://gdquest.com/post/2017/10/why-no-course-update-september/</link>

      <description>Godot 3 is coming out much later than planned. Alpha 2 isn&amp;rsquo;t even out yet. This means breaking changes keep happening on the engine. In the past few weeks alone there were important improvements to 2D physics and the UI system. The devs even renamed _fixed_process to _physics_process. Today I finished a long UI design tutorial only to learn a new Layout menu just arrived.
   This tutorial will show you how to create a flexible GUI in Godot   If I produced gameplay programming videos now for the course, they&amp;rsquo;d soon become obsolete.</description>
