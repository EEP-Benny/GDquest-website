      <description>Become a better game developer! With this course, you will learn to create the main mechanics and systems in your own games, using the Free Godot Game Engine.
Unlike in many beginner courses that show how to code a specific game step-by-step, this one will teach you professional game creation techniques you can apply to any type of game!
 Purchasing the Pro course is the best investment I have made.</description>

      <description>Godot 3 is coming out much later than planned. Alpha 2 isn&amp;rsquo;t even out yet. This means breaking changes keep happening on the engine. In the past few weeks alone there were important improvements to 2D physics and the UI system. The devs even renamed _fixed_process to _physics_process. Today I finished a long UI design tutorial only to learn a new Layout menu just arrived.
   This tutorial will show you how to create a flexible GUI in Godot   If I produced gameplay programming videos now for the course, they&amp;rsquo;d soon become obsolete.</description>
