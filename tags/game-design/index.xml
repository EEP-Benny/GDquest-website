      <description>Become a better game developer! With this course, you will learn to create the main mechanics and systems in your own games, using the Free Godot Game Engine.
Unlike in many beginner courses that show how to code a specific game step-by-step, this one will teach you professional game creation techniques you can apply to any type of game!
 Purchasing the Pro course is the best investment I have made.</description>

The Shop tutorial series will show you how to both design and code a flexible shop system. It works for J-RPGs, Western RPGs, and any type of game, really. The logic behind the Inventory and the Shop chapters can apply to a wide range of menus.</description>
