      <description>Last week we did a tutorial about attack mechanics in collaboration with Heartbeast. I got important feedback from you, the backers, and wanted to apply it to a self-contained tutorial. Consider it as a bonus while we&amp;rsquo;re waiting for Godot 3 beta.
Close combat attack:
 Weapon Animation  Weapon collision programming   Heartbeast&amp;rsquo;s tutorial:
 Ranged attack: fireball   It shows some of Godot&amp;rsquo;s strengths:
 Inherited scenes act as a base class that child scenes derive from, but you control it all through the editor.</description>

      <description>Godot 3 is coming out much later than planned. Alpha 2 isn&amp;rsquo;t even out yet. This means breaking changes keep happening on the engine. In the past few weeks alone there were important improvements to 2D physics and the UI system. The devs even renamed _fixed_process to _physics_process. Today I finished a long UI design tutorial only to learn a new Layout menu just arrived.
   This tutorial will show you how to create a flexible GUI in Godot   If I produced gameplay programming videos now for the course, they&amp;rsquo;d soon become obsolete.</description>

      <description>Do you want to become a better game developer? Gdquest will be on Kickstarter next week, to fund the creation of a game creation course for the new Godot game engine. More precisely for Godot 3, which will be out this summer!
I’m doing it with the devs&amp;rsquo; support: Rémi (akien) followed the project since the very beginning and ensured the project will be as good as it should be.</description>
