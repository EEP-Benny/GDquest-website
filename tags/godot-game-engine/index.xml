      <description>In this course, you will learn how to best create User Interfaces for your games with the open source Godot Engine.
This series is included in our larger Make Professional Games with Godot course. We made it as a standalone if you only want to learn about interface! So you only pay for the chapters you need ðŸ˜„
I&amp;rsquo;ve been one of the biggest contributors to Gdoot&amp;rsquo;s official UI tutorials, like the Intro to Godot&amp;rsquo;s UI system.</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s course update wraps up the UI arc of the project. With 3 chapters, it&amp;rsquo;s more content than initially planned (a recurring theme at this point), hopefully for the better ðŸ˜‰
The Shop tutorial series will show you how to both design and code a flexible shop system. It works for J-RPGs, Western RPGs, and any type of game, really. The logic behind the Inventory and the Shop chapters can apply to a wide range of menus.</description>

      <title>Godot 3 course: the boss chapter is out!</title>

      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s update you get one new chapter in the course. This is the hardest and probably the biggest series I made so far: chapter 5 is dedicated to boss creation.
This builds upon chapters 1 to 3 and brings the state programming pattern  to everyone, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve got the essentials, the indie, or the pro version.
As the boss chapter took twice the time I planned to invest in it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the essentials version in May.</description>

      <description>Do you want to become a better game developer? Gdquest will be on Kickstarter next week, to fund the creation of a game creation course for the new Godot game engine. More precisely for Godot 3, which will be out this summer!
Iâ€™m doing it with the devs&amp;rsquo; support: RÃ©mi (akien) followed the project since the very beginning and ensured the project will be as good as it should be.</description>

      <description>More than 600 of you gave feedback on the Godot course&amp;rsquo;s Kickstarter! That&amp;rsquo;s close to 3 times as many as last time, for the Krita game art project. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at what you had to say.
About the form&#39;s design There are 3 key questions you need to answer before you crowdfund a course: 1. Do enough people want it to happen? 2. Who are they? 3. What do they want?</description>

      <title>Game Creation with Godot, Kickstarter soon</title>

      <description>Update: the form&amp;rsquo;s results are available: Check them out!
Back in December 2015, hundreds supported gdquest on Kickstarter to bring out game art tutorials to Krita. Since then, I produced more than a hundred videos for it, and the first professional game art course.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to go full time with GDquest. Back then there was no website, a small community, I had few contacts to help me and no experience with crowdfunding.</description>
