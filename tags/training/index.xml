      <description>These tutorials are brought to you for free as part of the Kickstarter project Make Professional 2d Games with Godot. It was funded in 12h, and plenty of stretch goals were unlocked already. Please check it out!
This is an Open Source project. Both the assets and the code are available on Github, with comments to help you learn directly from the examples.</description>

      <description> The intro to monster design is the first free training released on GDquest. In about 40 minutes, it will run you through the thought process a game artist might follow to design monsters. It both covers the thought process behind the design of a monster and an example of monster drawing with pen, paper and Krita.
