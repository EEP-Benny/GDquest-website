      <description>The new update is out! As announced in the last news post, it&amp;rsquo;s smaller than usual. for two reasons:
 I moved to Japan, took some time off and had a lot to do to settle down I caught a cold and worked slower than usual for the past 10 days. Over the past week I barely had any voice at all  Work has still been busy until the end of the month: it not only took a while to get back to everyone, catch up with activity on GitHub, but also to get back up to speed in a foreign country.</description>

      <description>The 4th update of the Godot 3 course  is out! It includes the new tilesets and tilemap chapter, along with new videos to flesh out chapter 01.The character controller and chapter 08.Game pre-production.
Godot 3 just came out , and with some more work done on the official documentation and a nice collab with Mike from GameFromScratch, I will now focus my efforts fully on the course.
  The new website design by djrm looks gorgeous.</description>
