      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s course update wraps up the UI arc of the project. With 3 chapters, it&amp;rsquo;s more content than initially planned (a recurring theme at this point), hopefully for the better ðŸ˜‰
The Shop tutorial series will show you how to both design and code a flexible shop system. It works for J-RPGs, Western RPGs, and any type of game, really. The logic behind the Inventory and the Shop chapters can apply to a wide range of menus.</description>
