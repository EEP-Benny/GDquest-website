      <description>Become a better game developer! With this course, you will learn to create the main mechanics and systems in your own games, using the Free Godot Game Engine.
Unlike in many beginner courses that show how to code a specific game step-by-step, this one will teach you professional game creation techniques you can apply to any type of game!
 Purchasing the Pro course is the best investment I have made.</description>

      <description>Do you want to become a better game developer? Gdquest will be on Kickstarter next week, to fund the creation of a game creation course for the new Godot game engine. More precisely for Godot 3, which will be out this summer!
I’m doing it with the devs&amp;rsquo; support: Rémi (akien) followed the project since the very beginning and ensured the project will be as good as it should be.</description>
