      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s make the first professional 2-D game creation course for the Godot game engine a reality! The Kickstarter is now live. The higher the funding goes, the more content you will get. Every single cent will go to the project.
On top of that, for the next 30 days, you will get a free tutorial every day on YouTube.
