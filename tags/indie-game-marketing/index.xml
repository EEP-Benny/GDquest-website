      <description>Emmy Jonhassen, aka IndieGameGirl, gave a talk named Marketing Indie Games on a $0 Budget. It offers a nice introduction to the topic, so I decided to share synthetic notes for it.
I also wrote a detailed article on the topic for Game Analytics. There, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a lot more about everything I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined below. Check it out: Marketing Your Indie Game On A Zero-Dollar Budget
Emmy outlines 5 key types of contents required to maximize your game’s reach before and after its release.</description>
