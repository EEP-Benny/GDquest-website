      <description>Hi! If you&amp;rsquo;re here, you&amp;rsquo;re certainly a backer of the Game Art Quest Kickstarter campaign.
I moved the course to Gumroad, the same place where you got your premium brushes. Thanks to that change, you can now download the tutorials to watch offline! I sent your personal coupon code via email so you can get an instant free access.
How to redeem your coupon In the email, you will find a link that will automatically apply your coupon for you.</description>
