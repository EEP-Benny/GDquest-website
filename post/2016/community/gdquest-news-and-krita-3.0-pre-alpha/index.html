I wanted to keep you posted on what is going on right now with GDquest. The video says it all, but I’m going to sum up the news below.</p><p>With one last contract finished last week, and the series on monster design done, I am now working full-time on Game Art Quest. My top priority is to release the first version of the GAQ Krita brush back and to finish chapter 0 in the training. Once this is done, I will start releasing videos from the training publicly, at the rate of 1 to 2 per week.</p><p>I released the first 5 soundtracks from the project in an album called <a href="https://gdquest.bandcamp.com/album/space-adventures">Space Adventures</a>. They are available under the <strong>Creative Commons 4.0 license</strong>, so you can use them in <strong>both personal and commercial projects</strong>.</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; height: 307px" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1579881958/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://gdquest.bandcamp.com/album/space-adventures">Space adventures by Nathan Lovato</a></iframe><h2 id="your-votes-for-future-tutorials">Your votes for future tutorials</h2><p>Since January, I have been <a href="http://gdquest.com/post/2016/community/vote-for-upcoming-tutorials-january-2016/">running a vote</a> to ask you which tutorial series you wanted me to do this year aside from Krita. More than 400 people voted, and here are the themes you picked:</p><ol><li><strong>Overview of Godot 2.0, the open source game engine, for 2d games</strong></li><li><strong>Painting rock and grass tiles for 2d games</strong></li><li><strong>Human proportions, from reality to games</strong></li></ol><p>This is great, as they will reinforce <a href="http://gdquest.com/krita/game-art-quest/">Game Art Quest</a>. I might also do the 4th one, the Overview of <a href="http://superpowers-html5.com/">Superpowers, the collaborative HTML5 game engine</a>, as time permits.</p><h2 id="krita-3-0-pre-alpha-3">Krita 3.0, pre-alpha 3</h2><p><img src="\img\post\community\krita-gradient-map.png" alt="Krita gradient map filter" class="img-responsive"></p><p>The 3rd pre-alpha of Krita 3.0 was released! The development entered a feature-frozen state, and the full release of Krita 3.0 is planned for April 27. The features that didn’t make it in this version will be available in Krita 3.1.</p><p>Here’s a quick list of what is new in this pre-alpha:</p><ul><li>The improvements to the layer docker</li><li>The new grid and guides system, along with snapping</li><li>A gradient map filter</li><li>A greater alpha blending mode, useful for painting with the pixel brush engine</li><li>The foundations for 2 exporters. One is for spriter, the animation application for 2d games, and the other one is a csv-based format to exports animated sequences from krita.</li><li>A variety of improvements to the move tool, the crop tool, the assistants…</li></ul><p>Head on to the dedicated article on the official website to find the builds along with download instructions. It also features an exhaustive list of changes in this version.</p><p><em>That’s it for this update. See you soon, in the next one!</em></p></article></main><section id="author"><div class="card-box"><div class="content"><div class="image"><img class="img-circle" src="http://gdquest.com/img/avatar/nathan.png" alt="Nathan Lovato's picture"></div><p></p><h3>Nathan Lovato <small><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nathan.lovato.9"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> <span class="hidden">Mentor Facebook page</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <span class="hidden">Mentor Twitter page</span> <a href="http://youtube.com/c/gdquest"><i class="fa fa-youtube-play"></i> </a><span class="hidden">Mentor Youtube page</span></small></h3><p></p><p>I&#39;m a courteous game designer, with a taste for open source.
