      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s update you get one new chapter in the course. This is the hardest and probably the biggest series I made so far: chapter 5 is dedicated to boss creation.
This builds upon chapters 1 to 3 and brings the state programming pattern  to everyone, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve got the essentials, the indie, or the pro version.
As the boss chapter took twice the time I planned to invest in it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the essentials version in May.</description>

      <description>The new update is out! As announced in the last news post, it&amp;rsquo;s smaller than usual. for two reasons:
 I moved to Japan, took some time off and had a lot to do to settle down I caught a cold and worked slower than usual for the past 10 days. Over the past week I barely had any voice at all  Work has still been busy until the end of the month: it not only took a while to get back to everyone, catch up with activity on GitHub, but also to get back up to speed in a foreign country.</description>

      <description>Last week-end we went to the Capitole du Libre, a major event around Free Software in France, to showcase Godot. We met there with Gilles RoudiÃ¨re and Julian Murgia, two active contributors.
It was a busy event: even though there were fewer visitors than at FOSDEM, people kept coming to the Godot table, curious about the engine&amp;rsquo;s features.
Julian and Gilles gave a two-hours workshop based on @KidsCanCode&amp;rsquo;s Your first game  tutorial.</description>

      <description>Last week we did a tutorial about attack mechanics in collaboration with Heartbeast. I got important feedback from you, the backers, and wanted to apply it to a self-contained tutorial. Consider it as a bonus while we&amp;rsquo;re waiting for Godot 3 beta.
Close combat attack:
 Weapon Animation  Weapon collision programming   Heartbeast&amp;rsquo;s tutorial:
 Ranged attack: fireball   It shows some of Godot&amp;rsquo;s strengths:
 Inherited scenes act as a base class that child scenes derive from, but you control it all through the editor.</description>

      <description>Godot 3 is coming out much later than planned. Alpha 2 isn&amp;rsquo;t even out yet. This means breaking changes keep happening on the engine. In the past few weeks alone there were important improvements to 2D physics and the UI system. The devs even renamed _fixed_process to _physics_process. Today I finished a long UI design tutorial only to learn a new Layout menu just arrived.
   This tutorial will show you how to create a flexible GUI in Godot   If I produced gameplay programming videos now for the course, they&amp;rsquo;d soon become obsolete.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year already. 12 months, 12 consecutive updates. This anniversary release may not seem like much, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly the biggest so far. I redesigned all the brushes from scratch! The new thumbnails are circular. That way, all the information they can convey is available whether you look at the pop-up palette or the presets list. The design is also unique so that itâ€™s easy to differentiate from other bundles.</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to go full time with GDquest. Back then there was no website, a small community, I had few contacts to help me and no experience with crowdfunding.</description>

      <description>Yes, Iâ€™m back from Japan! Physically at least: my heart is still back there. Iâ€™ve been traveling around the country for a bit less than a month, and the experience was incredible. It was a great occasion to practice Japanese and get a better sense for the culture. Iâ€™ve read and been told a lot of things before going, and reality felt a lot subtler than what you would expect at first.</description>

      <description>Yes, the first volume of Game Art Quest is done. 6.2 hours of free Krita tutorials (some are still upcoming on the channel). 7 hours if you include the first bonus series of the year: Introduction to monster design for 2-D games. Looking back at the Kickstarter description, this is already more than the promised as far as the total length is concerned.
 Early access  Available tutorials (free)  The extra premium brushes and their companion tutorials are also getting pretty big.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since the last behind the scenes news post. There&amp;rsquo;s been good progress with the tutorials and the brushes. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work lately, especially changing my workflow to increase production speed, maintaining the same quality. On the other hand, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to update the website and social networks as often as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked. Aside from that&amp;hellip;

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting to the end of June. It&amp;rsquo;s time to sum up all that&amp;rsquo;s been happening this month. The short version: I kept improving the website, went to the biggest yearly KDE development sprint in Randa, Switzerland, and added about 1h of tutorials dedicated to Krita 3&amp;rsquo;s new features in the Krita training. You can find more details about what happened in Randa, and what the plans are for July, below.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;May has been a busy month. I did my best to keep up with everyone on social networks, to give a hand to the Krita developers, with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjIiI8uiVNM&#34;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; But I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to write longer news posts like this one. Time to share the news for this month! &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Never heard of Krita? It is a free, open source digital painting program that used to be Linux-only. Since 2 years though, there&amp;rsquo;s a Windows version, and the program is now being ported to Mac.
Krita 3 is a major update to an already powerful application. It brings it to a whole new level. It ships with a new rendering engine, a traditional animation toolset, an overhauled layers docker, rulers, grid, guides, snapping support, and a brand-new tablet code, which supports more Wacom alternatives.</description>

      <title>Hugo Tips: Concatenate paths with variables</title>

      <description>This tutorial is a post I initially wrote on the Hugo forums. Hugo is the static website generator that powers GDquest. It is a really flexible and elegant system, based on Google&amp;rsquo;s Go programming language. Sometimes, it is a bit hard to use for a non-tech-savvy user. So I decided to share some tips on things that got me stuck at some point. 
In a template, you sometimes need to load data from a path based on a parameter in your content fileâ€™s front matter.</description>

      <title>Recommended graphic tablets</title>

      <description>Recommended graphic tablets On this page, you can find a list of the graphic tablets I recommend for Game Art Quest. I used Frenden&amp;rsquo;s reviews as a reference to pick affordable tablets you can try out. I also asked feedback to fellow professionals who use Huion devices, as I only have Wacom tablets here. When you buy a graphic tablet, be sure to test your device and to use your right of withdrawal in case you don&amp;rsquo;t like it.</description>

      <description>Hi there! I wanted to keep you posted on what is going on right now with GDquest. The video says it all, but Iâ€™m going to sum up the news below.
With one last contract finished last week, and the series on monster design done, I am now working full-time on Game Art Quest. My top priority is to release the first version of the GAQ Krita brush back and to finish chapter 0 in the training.</description>
